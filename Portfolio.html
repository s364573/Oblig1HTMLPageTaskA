                <h3>Cookie clicker game project</h3>
                <p>My first biggest project was making cookie clicker in Java. At the start the project i built the GUI. 
                    It consisted of a button and a display the displayed the click count. 
                    But i struggled making the GUI looking good so i used a tutorial on Youtube that made the GUI look much better.
                    As u can see i made an upgrade on the right. If u click the cursor that costs 10 cookies(cookies) u will get one cookie per 10 seconds.

                <h3>This website</h3>
                <p>This website has been my first serious wedevelopment project ever. 
                    Me and my group started of with not even knowing what semantic tags to use, but as we kept trying
                    out different things we got better an better. 
                    Lining elements next to each other was really hard, but when we started making the site in gridpatterns it got much easier.
                    This project made me much better at designing.

                <h3>Making a calculator</h3>
                <p>When i started programming in Java i had a goal to make a calculator that could
                     add, subtract, divide and multiply 2 numbers. The project was the first project i started using classes and methods. 
                     This was a breakthrough in coding for me. I finally understood how to use classes and methods in a program and it helped me a lot in my later projects.
                     It didnt have GUI, but that my next project.
                </p>
